One of the major issues of developing countries is the conditions of the roads. Potholes are one of the main reasons behind poor road conditions and has caused a large number of accidents, thereby causing loss of lives. 
Potholes can generate damage such as flat tire and wheel damage, impact and damage of lower vehicle, vehicle collision, and major accidents. 
Thus, accurately and quickly detecting potholes is one of the important tasks for determining proper strategies in ITS (Intelligent Transportation System) service and road management system. 
Several efforts have been made for developing a technology which can automatically detect and recognize potholes. Detection of potholes will therefore benefit people for safer commutation. 
In our system, the use of Ultrasonic sensors has minimized the problem of accuracy which was faced previously. 
The sensor that is attached below the truck will sense the data that is depth of the pothole and sends the data to Arduino.
The truck contains concrete. With the help of the information stored in the Arduino the pothole is filled automatically with concrete present in the truck according to the requirement.
